# Contributing Guidelines

## Basics

To start your contribution, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a fork of this repo

2. Git clone your fork to your machine

```sh
git clone url://to.your/github/fork.git
```

3. Use dev branch, commits targetting main will be ignored.

```sh
git checkout -b dev remotes/upstream/dev
```

4. Make changes as you want

5. Commit your changes

```sh
git commit -m "concise message of the change"
```

`Tip: you can set up code signing and add -S to the commit command above to get a verified check mark`

6. Push your changes

```sh
git push
```

7. Create pull request on GitHub
